With v0.1.0 a new file `Reflection` (with `ReflectionComment`) is integrated into the program. A reflection can be a poem, a quotation, a saying or a little thought during the morning.

Write it down into a new Reflection file and then reflect over it (like how in a blog where an article can be comment).
